Login Server Specification v1.0
-------------------------------

    Request
    -------
        Format
        ------
The format of the parameters passed to the login portion of the Icarrus server must be in the form of a standard HTTP POST request.

        Parameters
        ----------
username    --  Required parameter. Will contain the username of the user attempting to login to the server.
password    --  Required parameter. Will contain the password used to authenticate the user.
file(s)*    --  Optional parameter. Files being sent to the server as part of a one-time login/upload transaction. This parameter is to facilitate the user of a possible shell extension upload mechanism
                where a user would be allowed to right click a file in the OS's file explorer system and select an option to upload to the server with a giver username/password set. This parameter is only
                theoretical at the moment and is not currently supported by any Icarrus server implementation.

* This parameter is currently not supported or used in any context. This is merely here for reference to possible uses in future releases.

    Reponse
    -------
        Format
        ------
The format of the response is to be standard XML.

        Parameters
        ----------
status      --  Required parameter. A string containing the status of the login transaction. Acceptable values will either be "valid" or "invalid" where "valid" is a successful login to the server and "invalid" indicates some
                problem with either the username, password, or error on the server's part that caused the login to not be valid.
error       --  Optional parameter. A string describing the reason the server returned an "invalid" status for a login. This is used in the logging to aid as a source of reference for solutions to problems
                users may have with the Icarrus platform.
