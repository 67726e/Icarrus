Upload Server Specification v1.0
--------------------------------

    Request
    -------
        Format
        ------
The format of the parameters passed to the upload portion of the Icarrus server must be in the form of a standard HTTP POST (multipart) request.

        Parameters
        ----------
username    --  Required parameter. Contains the username of the user attempting to upload a file to the Icarrus server. This is used to validate the user and log his/her actions.
password    --  Required parameter. Contains the MD5 hash of the user's password to validate the account transaction thus denying unauthorized attempts to login.
token*      --  Required parameter. Contains a random token used to validate the upload. This will thwart most attempts to share an account.
file        --  Required parameter. Contains the multipart chunked binary data of the file being uploaded to the Icarrus server.

* This parameter is under consideration for removal from the next Icarrus release.

    Response
    --------
        Format
        ------
To allow for the expansion of parameters while maintaining backwards compatibility, the Icarrus server's response schema is to follow the IDAT File specification. No modifications to this specification
are being taken at this time.

        Parameters
        ----------
status      --  Required Parameter. Contains the status of the upload. Will return "valid" if the upload was successfully completed or "invalid" if there was a problem on the server's part of the transaction.
token*      --  Optional Parameter. Contains a unique identifier to allow the user to perform a new upload transaction with the server.
url         --  Optional Parameter. Contains the URL of the file that was uploaded to the Icarrus server. This will only return if the status is "valid"
error       --  Optional Parameter. Contains an error message regarding the failure on the server's end. May not exist even when the transaction was "invalid".

* This parameter is under consideration for removal from the next Icarrus release.
