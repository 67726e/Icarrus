IDAT (Icarrus DATa) File Specification v1.0
-------------------------------------------

The IDAT (Icarrus DATa) file specification sets the framework for the entire data storage solution
for the Icarrus application. A standard IDAT file is technically readable by any Icarrus file parser
but the underlying parameters may not mean anything to the particular implementation and will thus
be ignored as useless data.

    Format
    ------
The contents of a standard IDAT file are parameter/value pairs that specify a parameter name and the
value associated with that parameter. A standard parameter must match the following schema:
    A) All IDAT parameters/value pairs must begin with a tilde '~' and end with a single newline character '\n'
    B) The parameter name must immediately follow the tilde '~' and end with a single colon ':' with no whitespace
    C) The value associated with the parameter may not contain any tildes '~' or newline characters '\n' as a part of it's data
    D) The value associated with the parameter name follows the colon ':'. Any colons within the value section must be substituted with a tilde '~'.

    Parsing
    -------
To allow for the expansion of the IDAT file format, the following rules regarding data input must be followed by any IDAT file parser:
    A) Any line not beginning with a tilde '~' (whitespace non-withstanding) are to be ignored as if it were not there.
    B) While writing IDAT data to file, all colons ':' within the value portion are to be substituted with a tilde '~'
    C) While reading IDAT data from file, all tildes '~' within the value portion are to be substituted with a colon ':'
