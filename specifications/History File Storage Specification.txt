History File Storage Specification v1.0
---------------------------------------

The history file is used to store any data related to the user's file upload history. Typical attributes include but are not limited to
the date the file was uploaded, the URL returned for the file, the file size, and the file name. The format of stored data is based upon
the IDAT (Icarrus DATa) specification with minor alterations to account for the tabular nature of the data stored within.

    Format
    ------
Given that the history information is of a tabular nature, slight alterations to the IDAT format have been taken for the History data
storage. A standard history entry for a single file must match the schema as follows:
    A) The indication of a file entry is "~File {" ending with a single newline '\n' character.
    B) The indication of the end of a file entry is "}" followed by a single newline '\n' character
    C) All parameters inside of the file entry block must meet the standard IDAT specification for parameters
    D) Following the IDAT specification, all unknown lines or parameters inside of the file entry block are to be ignored.

~File {
    ~filename:example.txt
    ~filesize:233
    ~fileurl:http~//icarrus.us/server~8080
    ~uploaddate:2/5/2011 @ 13~45
}
