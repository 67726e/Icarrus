Icarrus
=======

What
----
Icarrus in an open source alternative to Dropbox. Icarrus is not just the desktop application, but a whole
suite to use, setup, and manage your files the way you want them to be managed.

Why
---
Why Icarrus? Icarrus was written to allow a simplistic file storing solution "in the cloud" with a consistent interface
across all platforms. Icarrus is not for the faint of heart. Icarrus was made with the intent to allow you to run your
own Icarrus server, thus keeping you in control of how your data is or isn't used.

Requirements
------------
*   JRE 6
*   OS Capable of Alpha Transparency
